Noob test 1

Firat attempt on flimsy phone to get the hang of writing core n save files. 
I'd say phat fingers, flimsy phone and mobile interface isnt helping..
neither are the auto correct that keeps buggin me. Oh well. The way to mastery 
is Chopping wood n carrying water..and at mastery..u keep choppin wood n carrying 
water so I guess its no real rush to get done.
